# 🚗 Car Dataset Regression Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **mileage (`kilometer`)** of cars based on various features. The dataset contains **371,528 entries** with **21 columns**, including both numerical and categorical attributes. The target variable for this regression task is `kilometer`.

The main goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the mileage of a vehicle given its characteristics.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values in both numerical and categorical columns.
   - Fill numerical missing values using **mean** and categorical missing values using **mode**.
   - Encode categorical variables:
     - One-hot encoding for columns with low cardinality 🎯.
     - Label encoding for columns with high cardinality 🏷️.
   - Scale numerical features (excluding the target `kilometer`) using **MinMaxScaler** 📏.

2. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand distributions of numerical and categorical features 📈.
   - Visualize relationships between features and target variable (`kilometer`) 🔍.
   - Check for outliers and data inconsistencies ⚠️.

3. **🤖 Modeling**
   - Apply regression algorithms to predict `kilometer`.
   - Potential models include:
     - Linear Regression 📐
     - Random Forest Regressor 🌳
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor 🚀
     - XGBoost / LightGBM ⚡
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score** 📏.

4. **🚀 Deployment (Optional)**
   - Prepare the pipeline for future deployment.
   - Include preprocessing steps so that new data can be used for prediction.
